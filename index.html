<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
E Hyperchloramic acidosis<br><br>
The anion gap is normal (146+4)-(122+16)=. The other listed causes would cause a high anion gap acidosis. Historically there was a trend to give  pancreatitis patients lots of fluid which may stop with recent data. <br><br>

Urine dip: LEU -ve, BLOOD -ve, NIT -ve, pH 7.5-8.0<br><br>

What is the likely cause of this mans presentation<br><br>

A Drug induced Type 1 RTA<br>
B Toxic alcohol poisoning<br>
C Diabetic Ketoacidosis<br>
D Aspirin Overdose<br>
E Acetazolamide use<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
A Drug induced Type 1 RTA<br><br>
The anion gap is normal (125+5)-(115+5)=10 and the urine is inappropriately alkaline. Toxic alcohol, Ketoacidosis and Aspirin overdose will cause high anion gap acidosis. Acetazolamide will cause a Proximal RTA picture with a normal anion gap acidosis but is unlikley to cause such a severe acidosis. The history is more consistent with Solvent (toluene) abuse causing a distal Type 1 RTA. <br>Type 1 RTA is reduced secretion of H+ in the distal tubule leading to alkaline urine. Treatment is with IV bicarbonate

What is the most likely cause of the hyponatraemia<br><br>

A Thiazide diurectics<br>
B PPI<br>
C TURP syndrome<br>
D Psuedohyponatramia<br>
E Intraoperative renal loss of sodium<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
C TURP syndrome<br><br>
TURP syndrome is cuased by intraoperative absorption of glycine cuasing an isoosmolar hyponatreamia. The medications could cause hyponatreamia but they are unlikely to suddenly cause such a severe drop. <br>The treatment is as for other hyponatramias includeing hypertonic saline if Na is below 120 or there are neurological complications.

SBA 0010<br>A 40 year old is being treated for aortic valve endocarditis on ICU. <br>


What is a criteria for urgent surgical referral?<br><br>

A Multiple New Cerebral emboli <br>
B Increasing size of vegetation on ECHO <br>
C Worsening PR prolongation<br>
D Persistent Hypertension<br>
E Streptococcus bovis positive cultures<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
C Worsening PR prolongation<br><br>
PR prolongation can represent the development or worsening of an Aortic valve abscess. This generally needs urgent seugery. Cardiothoracics may want further imaging before transfer. Cerebral emboli are concerning and previously there have been concerns regarding anticoagulation ofr bypass but current guidelines do not recommend delaying surgery. Staph aureus IE often requires surgical intervention. <br>Yanagawa, B., Pettersson, G. B., Habib, G., Ruel, M., Saposnik, G., Latter, D. A., & Verma, S. (2016).

<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
B PTU, Hydrocortisone and Beta blockade<br><br>
This question is supposed to decribe a thyroid storm with trigger being iodinated contrast. The recent CT scan and reassuring blood results make an acute surgical emergency or sepsis less likely. 
  DKA can present with abdominal pain and weight loss but you would expect ketones and glucose in the urine. Pheochromocytoma would present with hypertension and may have been found on the recent CT <br>

What would be her 4 T score and what would be the coorect treatment<br><br>

A 8, Stop heparin and anticoagulate with non heparin alternative<br>
B 8. Stop Heparin and no futher anticoagulation due to low platelets<br>
C 4, Stop heparin and start Warfarin for the DVT<br>
D 4, Stop heparin and anticoagulate with non heparin alternative<br>
E 8, Stop heparin and start prophylactic dose fondaparinux<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
A 8, Stop heparin and anticoagulate with non heparin alternative<br><br>
This case is supposed to describe HIT. They score maximum points on the 4T score with 2 points for the extent of the thrombocytopenia, 2 for the timing, 2 for having throbosis and 2 for there not being a possible alternative. In this case treatment needs to be started by stoping heparin and anticoagulating with an alternative depending on patient factors. Warfarin is contraindicated until platelet count has normalised.
  <br>
  Type II HIT (as in this case) is casued by immune response to PF4/Heparin complexes. The antibodies can be detected on bloods but can take several days to come back and still need to be interpreted with the clinical picture.

What is the cause of the hyponatramia<br><br>

A Hypothyroidism<br>
B Addisons<br>
C Excess water consumption<br>
D SIADH<br>
E Psuedohyponatraemia<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
<b> D SIADH </b><br><br>
This is a vague question but regardless, this lady has hyponatraemia with low serum osmolality. The urine sodium in inapproprately high and urine osmolality is higher than the serum. This means this is most likely SIADH.  Addisons is a possibility but the low normal K reading makes this less likely. 
  Hypothyroidism as the cause of hyponatreamia is somewhat controversal but would present with SIADH type picture, but is less likley with a high heart rate. Excess water consumption would result in dilute urine with low urine osmolality </details>

  SBA 0014 Aortic trauma Title<br> What is the most common site of aortic injury in blunt trauma?<br><br>

A Abdominal aorta<br>

C Arch<br>
D Proximal Descending<br>
E Distal descending<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
<b> D Proximal Descending </b><br><br>
The ligamentum arteriosum fixes the aorta to the chest was just distal to the left subclavian artery and this is the most common site of injury. The aortic isthmus in the area between the ligamentum arteriosum and this accounts for 90% of throacic aorta injury.

SBA 0017 Arrythmia<br> A 55 year old patient is referred to ICU for cardiac monitoring following recurrent syncope. The paramedic brings you an ECG which is shown below. The patient is currently awake and informs you this has never happened before and no one in his family have had any heart trouble. <br> 

Their regular medications are phenytoin and paracetamol. The phenytoin dose was recently reduced due to him not having any seizures for many years. The ED team have given magnesium and are planning to give a magnesium infusion<br>

  <br>A point of care blood test shows Na 135, K 3.9, Ionized Ca 1.3, Mg 2.0, Creat 110, Urea 9
Of the following what should the next treatment be<br><br>

A Stop Phenytoin<br>
B Amiodarone infusion<br>
C Lidocaine infusion<br>
D IV potassium replacement<br>
E Calcium chloride 10ml 10%<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
<b> D IV potassium replacement </b><br><br>
The ECG strip clearly shows torsades de points (it also appears to show a defibrillator shock which the patient did not mention). This with the recurrent syncopal episodes means he at least needs to be admitted for further workup. Stopping phenytoin would not be helpful in fact it may have some protective action in this case. Amiodarone extended QT interval and so is not the treatment of choice. Lidocaine infusions have been suggested in the literature but would be reserved for refractory cases. The potassium should be replaced to a goal of 4.5. Calcium should be corrected to within normal limits which this is alreay achieved.

D DDAVP<br>
E Terlipressin infusion<br>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
<b> D DDAVP </b><br><br>
Whilst you don't have a urine osmolality as yet the specific gravity is low indicating dilute urine. This with the clinical picture, hypernatreamia and urine sodium indicate diabetes insipidus. Terlipressin may help but has lower affinity for V2 receptors than DDAVP. Methyprednisoone is recommneded after brain death but 
not specifically for Diabetes insipidus. Replacement of lost fluid is necessary also but is not a disease modifying treatment.<br>https://www.odt.nhs.uk/deceased-donation/best-practice-guidance/donor-optimisation/</details>

Textbooks<br>
- The Final FFICM Structures Oral Examination Study Guide, Davies: In my opinion the best book for the SOE<br>
  - Single Best Answer Questions for the final FFICM, Davies et al: Many questions with good explanations. Has mixed reviews from peers and some questions are out of date. Some of the questions feel too easy to be in the acutual exam<br>
  - Questions for the final FFICM Structured oral Examination, Flavin et al: Extensive detailed book similar but does not have questions in the format of the MCQ Exam. <br>
  - Clinical Cases in Critical Care Paperback, Myers Samuels: A useful case book with explanations. It doesnt cover as many topics as the other textbooks but gives more in depth explanations rather than bullet points. The SBA section is short but has questions which appear more similar to the exam than the other sources.<br>
  <br>

Websites<br>
- Deranged Physiology is a somewhat verbose but excellent resource on basic sciences and I would highly recommend. It also has all the previous CICM exam questions with explanations of the answers given by the Australian college.<br>
