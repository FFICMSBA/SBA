E TBI with Mean arterial pressure below 80<br><br>

B GCS <8 with abnormal motor posturing and age over 40<br><br>

BTF 2016 TBI guidlines have the following criteria for ICP monitoring<br>
- GCS <12 who cannot not be serially assess due to sedation<br>
- GCS <8 with and abnormal CT head<br>
- GCS <8 with with an normal scan if 2 of the following present: Age>40, SBP <90, Abdnormal motor posturing<br>
<br>
There is no accounting for seizure activity.

SBA 0003 Choice of Ulcer prophylaxis<br>A patient is transferred to intubated ICU with hospital acquired pnuemonia following a STEMI for with he had a stent to the LAD. The cardiologists want to continue his cardiac medication (aspirin, clopidogrel, ramipril, bisoprolol, furosemide, spironaloactone). He has had previous upper gi bleeding and recently had a course of NSAIDs for back pain <br>

What is the most suitable choice for ulcer prophylaxis?<br><br>

A Omeprazole<br>
B Esomeprazole<br>
C Gavison<br>
D Lanzoprazole<br>
E Withholding enteral feeding<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary>
<br> D Lanzoprazole<br><br>

Omeprazole and esomeprazole reduce clopirogrel absorption. Lansoprazole is an appropriate alternative. Witholding enteral feeding is not indicated in this case

A Plasmapheresis<br><br>
This patient has thromobocytopenia and neurological signs with a blood film consistent with MAHA. He likely has renal dysfunction also. He does not have fever which is part of the classic triad but is only present initally in a fifth of patients The most likely diagnosis is TTP. <br><br>The disease modifying treatment is plasmapheresis which removes the vWF multimers and some of the anti-ADAMTS13 antibody in addition to replacing the ADAMTS 13. <br><br> TMA, IBCC https://emcrit.org/ibcc/tma/

SBA 0006 Metabolic Acidosis<br> You review a patient with pancreatitis on the surgical ward. They have the following blood gas:<br><br>

pH 7.30<br>
pO2 8.4 kPa<br>
pCO2 4.3 kPa<br>
Bicarb 16 mmol/L<br>
BE -9 mmol/l<br>
Na 146 mmol/L<br>

Cl 122 mmol/L<br>
Glu 14<br><br>

What is the cause of the acidosis?<br><br>

A Lactic Acidosis <br>
B Ketoacidosis <br>
C Renal failure<br>
D Pyroglutamic acidosis<br>
E Hyperchloramic acidosis<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
E Hyperchloramic acidosis<br><br>
The anion gap is normal (146+4)-(122+16)=. The other listed causes would cause a high anion gap acidosis. Historically there was a trend to give  pancreatitis patients lots of fluid which may stop with recent data. <br><br>

SBA 0007 Metabolic acidosis <br>An 20 year old presents with confused from a party. You are asked to review him in A+E due to his blood gas results. The nurse also managed to get a urine dip while they were planning to do a urine tox screen<br><br>
ph 7.01<br>
pO2 13.4 kPa<br>
pCO2 2.5 kPa<br>
HCO3 5 mmol/L<br>
BE - 25 mmol/L <br>
Na 125 mmol/L <br>
K 4 mmol/L<br>
Cl 115mmol/<br><br>
Urine dip: LEU -ve, BLOOD -ve, NIT -ve, pH 7.5-8.0<br><br>

What is the likely cause of this mans presentation<br><br>

A Drug induced Type 1 RTA<br>
B Toxic alcohol poisoning<br>
C Diabetic Ketoacidosis<br>
D Aspirin Overdose<br>
E Acetazolamide use<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
A Drug induced Type 1 RTA<br><br>
The anion gap is normal (125+5)-(115+5)=10 and the urine is inappropriately alkaline. Toxic alcohol, Ketoacidosis and Aspirin overdose will cause high anion gap acidosis. Acetazolamide will cause a Proximal RTA picture with a normal anion gap acidosis but is unlikley to cause such a severe acidosis. The history is more consistent with Solvent (toluene) abuse causing a distal Type 1 RTA. <br>Type 1 RTA is reduced secretion of H+ in the distal tubule leading to alkaline urine. Treatment is with IV bicarbonate

SBA 0008 Hyponatraemia <br>You are called to recovery to review a 80 year old man who is acutely confused up after a day case urology procedure. His medication list is below which he has been on for a long tim. He had a normal set of bloods at pre op clinic. The anaesthetic team have run a VBG<br><br>
Regular Meds: Bendroflumethiazide 2.5mg OD, Ramipril 5mg OD, Omeprazole 20mg od, Tamsulosin 400mcg od<br><br>
VBG<br>
pH 7.34<br>
paO2 9.0 kPa<br>
paCO2 4.5 kPa<br>
HCO3 20 mmol/L<br>
BE -3 mmol/L<br>
Na 110 mmol/L<br>
K 4 mmol/l<br>
Hb 95<br><br>

What is the most likely cause of the hyponatraemia<br><br>

A Thiazide diurectics<br>
B PPI<br>
C TURP syndrome<br>
D Psuedohyponatramia<br>
E Intraoperative renal loss of sodium<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
C TURP syndrome<br><br>
TURP syndrome is cuased by intraoperative absorption of glycine cuasing an isoosmolar hyponatreamia. The medications could cause hyponatreamia but they are unlikely to suddenly cause such a severe drop. <br>The treatment is as for other hyponatramias includeing hypertonic saline if Na is below 120 or there are neurological complications.

SBA 0009 Respiratory<br>You are asked to review a patient on the care of the elderly ward cough and shortness of breath. She had a long course of high dose oral steroids for Polymyalgia rheumatica. The respiratory team gave telephone advice to order a set of blood and do a HR CT chest scan but they have not reviewed the patient yet<br><br>

Assuming the likely diagnosis is confirmed what is the first line antimicrobial treatment<br><br>

A Voriconazole<br>
B Nystatin<br>
C Septrin<br>

A Voriconazole <br><br>
This patient invasive pulmonary aspiergilloisis evidenced by the immunosuppresion, positive glactomamman and CT findings. The current recommened first line treatment is Voriconazole. Second line is Amphoteracin. Enchinocandins can also be used but this is not recommeneded as first line.

Resources
<br>
Textbooks<br>
- The Final FFICM Structures Oral Examination Study Guide, Davies: In my opinion the best book for the SOE<br><br>

Websites<br>
- Deranged Physiology is a somewhat verbose but excellent resource on basic sciences and I would highly recommend. It also has all the previous CICM exam questions with explanations of the answers given by the Australian college.<br><br>

Question banks<br>
- BMJ On examination, FFICM: This is poor quality, there are a lot of True/false questions which are no longer in FFICM MCQ, many questions are repeated and some are clearly copied from other Anaesthetic and Gen med question banks and have little relevance to critical care.
