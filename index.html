What is the likely cause of this mans presentation<br><br>

A Drug induced Type 1 RTA<br>
B Toxic alcohol poisoning<br>
C Diabetic Ketoacidosis<br>
D Aspirin Overdose<br>
E Acetazolamide use<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
A Drug induced Type 1 RTA<br><br>
The anion gap is normal (125+5)-(115+5)=10 and the urine is inappropriately alkaline. Toxic alcohol, Ketoacidosis and Aspirin overdose will cause high anion gap acidosis. Acetazolamide will cause a Proximal RTA picture with a normal anion gap acidosis but is unlikley to cause such a severe acidosis. The history is more consistent with Solvent (toluene) abuse causing a distal Type 1 RTA. <br>Type 1 RTA is reduced secretion of H+ in the distal tubule leading to alkaline urine. Treatment is with IV bicarbonate

SBA 0010<br>A 40 year old is being treated for aortic valve endocarditis on ICU. <br>


What is a criteria for urgent surgical referral?<br><br>

A Multiple New Cerebral emboli <br>
B Increasing size of vegetation on ECHO <br>
C Worsening PR prolongation<br>
D Persistent Hypertension<br>
E Streptococcus bovis positive cultures<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
C Worsening PR prolongation<br><br>
PR prolongation can represent the development or worsening of an Aortic valve abscess. This generally needs urgent seugery. Cardiothoracics may want further imaging before transfer. Cerebral emboli are concerning and previously there have been concerns regarding anticoagulation ofr bypass but current guidelines do not recommend delaying surgery. Staph aureus IE often requires surgical intervention. <br>Yanagawa, B., Pettersson, G. B., Habib, G., Ruel, M., Saposnik, G., Latter, D. A., & Verma, S. (2016).

B PTU, Hydrocortisone and Beta blockade<br><br>
This question is supposed to decribe a thyroid storm with trigger being iodinated contrast. The recent CT scan and reassuring blood results make an acute surgical emergency or sepsis less likely. 
  DKA can present with abdominal pain and weight loss but you would expect ketones and glucose in the urine. Pheochromocytoma would present with hypertension and may have been found on the recent CT <br>

What would be her 4 T score and what would be the coorect treatment<br><br>

A 8, Stop heparin and anticoagulate with non heparin alternative<br>
B 8. Stop Heparin and no futher anticoagulation due to low platelets<br>
C 4, Stop heparin and start Warfarin for the DVT<br>

A 8, Stop heparin and anticoagulate with non heparin alternative<br><br>
A similar question has been in the MCQ in 2024. This case is supposed to describe HIT. They score maximum points on the 4T score with 2 points for the extent of the thrombocytopenia, 2 for the timing, 2 for having throbosis and 2 for there not being a possible alternative. In this case treatment needs to be started by stoping heparin and anticoagulating with an alternative depending on patient factors. Warfarin is contraindicated until platelet count has normalised. 
  <br>
  Type II HIT (as in this case) is casued by immune response to PF4/Heparin complexes. The antibodies can be detected on bloods but can take several days to come back and still need to be interpreted with the clinical picture.

What is the cause of the hyponatramia<br><br>

A Hypothyroidism<br>
B Addisons<br>
C Excess water consumption<br>
D SIADH<br>
E Psuedohyponatraemia<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
<b> D SIADH </b><br><br>
This is a vague question but regardless, this lady has hyponatraemia with low serum osmolality. The urine sodium in inapproprately high and urine osmolality is higher than the serum. This means this is most likely SIADH.  Addisons is a possibility but the low normal K reading makes this less likely. 
  Hypothyroidism as the cause of hyponatreamia is somewhat controversal but would present with SIADH type picture, but is less likley with a high heart rate. Excess water consumption would result in dilute urine with low urine osmolality </details>

D Proximal Descending<br>
E Distal descending<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
<b> D Proximal Descending </b><br><br>
The ligamentum arteriosum fixes the aorta to the chest was just distal to the left subclavian artery and this is the most common site of injury. The aortic isthmus in the area between the ligamentum arteriosum and this accounts for 90% of throacic aorta injury.

SBA 0017 Arrythmia<br> A 55 year old patient is referred to ICU for cardiac monitoring following recurrent syncope. The paramedic brings you an ECG which is shown below. The patient is currently awake and informs you this has never happened before and no one in his family have had any heart trouble. <br> 

Their regular medications are phenytoin and paracetamol. The phenytoin dose was recently reduced due to him not having any seizures for many years. The ED team have given magnesium and are planning to give a magnesium infusion<br>

  <br>A point of care blood test shows Na 135, K 3.9, Ionized Ca 1.3, Mg 2.0, Creat 110, Urea 9
Of the following what should the next treatment be<br><br>

A Stop Phenytoin<br>
B Amiodarone infusion<br>
C Lidocaine infusion<br>
D IV potassium replacement<br>
E Calcium chloride 10ml 10%<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
<b> D IV potassium replacement </b><br><br>
The ECG strip clearly shows torsades de points (it also appears to show a defibrillator shock which the patient did not mention). This with the recurrent syncopal episodes means he at least needs to be admitted for further workup. Stopping phenytoin would not be helpful in fact it may have some protective action in this case. Amiodarone extended QT interval and so is not the treatment of choice. Lidocaine infusions have been suggested in the literature but would be reserved for refractory cases. The potassium should be replaced to a goal of 4.5. Calcium should be corrected to within normal limits which this is alreay achieved.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
<b> D DDAVP </b><br><br>
Whilst you don't have a urine osmolality as yet the specific gravity is low indicating dilute urine. This with the clinical picture, hypernatreamia and urine sodium indicate diabetes insipidus. Terlipressin may help but has lower affinity for V2 receptors than DDAVP. Methyprednisoone is recommneded after brain death but 
not specifically for Diabetes insipidus. Replacement of lost fluid is necessary also but is not a disease modifying treatment.<br>https://www.odt.nhs.uk/deceased-donation/best-practice-guidance/donor-optimisation/</details>

  SBA 0022 Pharmacology of Dexmedetomidine <br> You listen to an american podcast on sedation in critical care and you decide to switch a patient to Precedex.
  <br>
Which of the following is FALSE regarding Dexmedetomidine?<br>
A It is a highly selective alpha 2 agonist <br>
B It undergoes hepatic metabolism  <br>
C Its duration of action is independent of duration of infusion  <br>
D Can cause bradycardia and hypotension <br>
E It is highly protein bound <br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
<b> C Its half life is independent of duration of infusion  </b><br><br>
Dexmedetomidines metabolism has been in recent exams (2024). Its elimination half life after prolonged infusion is 2-4 hours. Its mechanism is by hyperpolarising the PREsynaptic membrane by activating the alpha2 receptors. It has a high hepatic extraction ratio and effects can be prolonged in hepatic failure. It is 96% protein bound and in patient with low albumin there can be an increased VOD as there is less protein in the blood for it to bind to.

  SBA 0023 Pharmacology of Propofol <br>
Which of the following is FALSE regarding propofol?<br>
A It has metabolites which are have some GABAa agonist effects <br>
B Metabolites are excreted in urine <br>
C Metabolism is by glucouronide and sulphate conjugation <br>
D Activation of the GABAa channels leads to influx of chloride ions <br>
E Hepatic impairment can affect Propofol metabolism <br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
<b> A It has metabolites which are have some GABAa agonist effects </b><br><br>
Propofol is primarily metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites. The major pathways include conjugation with glucuronic acid and sulphate oxidation. Metabolites are excreted in urine, and hepatic impairment can impact its metabolism. The influx of chloride ions leads to membrane hyperpolarisation.

<b> C 40 </b><br><br>
A similar question has appeared in a recent exam. Unfortunately there is no actual clear answer with different societies recommmending different cut offs. American sources seem to recommend 50 whilst the Association of British Neurologists recommend 40. 
  In general you should not check clotting or platelets in patients prior to a routine LP but assess the risk of a coagulopathy clinically, but this probably does not apply to ICU patients. Regardless reference is below for the British Neurologist guideline<br>https://doi.org/10.1136/practneurol-2017-001820

  SBA 0025 Parkland Formula for Burns <br> A rugby player was attending his clubs summer barbeque when he was badly burnt when trying to light a bonfire.
He is 100kg with 50% total body surface area full thickness burns. The Paramedics gave him 1000mL NaCl 0.9% and ED have also given 1000mL of Plasmalyte. <br><Br>  According to the Parkland Formula, How much further fluid should he receive in the 8 hrs following the burn<br>
A 4,000 mL <br>
B 6,000 mL <br>
C 8,000 mL <br>

<b> C 8,000 mL </b><br><br> It is not clear whether following parkland formular is the correct method to follow with burns resucitation, regardless this is an easy question and has come up previously. <br>
The Modified Parkland Formula recommends administering 4 mL/kg/% burn for the first 24 hours, with half of the total calculated volume given in the first 8 hours. For this patient (100kg with 50% burns), the calculation would be: 4*100*50 = 20,000ml. Half of this (10,000 mL) should be administered in the first 8 hours for resuscitation. The patient received 2 litres prior to your review leaving 8 litres to be given in the first 8 hours.

  SBA 0026 Troubleshooting the dialysis circuit <br> A 45 year old with vasopressor resistant septic shock and renal failure secondary to Group A streptococcus infection is on your unit. He was previously well but is reaching the limits of ICU care. There is no availability of VA ECMO in your region. You are asked to review him on your night shift because the renal replacement machine is constantly alarming.<Br>
  He has a Vascath in the RIJ and the tip appears in the right atrium on CXR.<br> You review the pressures on the machine: Access pressure: -100 mmHg (-50 to -150 mmHg), Pre-Filter pressure 150 mmHg (100 to 250 mmHg), Return pressure: 100 mmHg (50 to 150 mmHg).<br><br> The Blood leak alarm is flashing on the screen.<br> <br> His latest bloods show Hb 110, WCC 25, Plt 75, Urea 15, Creat 450, ALT 120, Bili 5, CRP 450 <br> <br> He is requiring noradrenaline 0.5mcg/kg/min and vasopressin 2.4unit/hr but this is greatly improved over 12 hours ago.

A Haemolysis causing free haem to cause the blood leak alarm <br>
B Rupture of the filter <br>
C Misplaced Vascath <br>
D Hydroxycobalamin<br>
E Filter has clotted <br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
<b> D Hydroxycobalamin </b><br><br> Hydroxycobalamin can be used is septic shock as a nitric oxide scavenger when other methods have not worked. It leads to a discolouration of all body fluids and can cause the blood leak alarm. This can be very difficult to manage in patients who are dependent on RRT. Some work arounds are putting sterile water in the blood leak detector but this is clearly not recommended!<br> Filter rupture is also a possibility here but less likely with a stable Hb and improving vasopressor requirments. Filter clotting, misplace vascath would not cause the blood leak alarm. There is no evidence of significant haemolysis on the patients bloods.

<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary>
<br><strong>D Increased need for calcium replacement post filter</strong><br><br>
  This patient is at high risk for citrate toxicity due to hepatic failure.&nbsp;
  <br><br>If need for calcium replacement is increasing it may indicate citrate toxicity. A Metabolic Alkalosis is incorrect as it indicates citrate overload rather than toxicity, the alkalosis indicates the citrate is being metabolised by the liver leading to alkalosis from the remaining Na+. B is incorrect as&nbsp;citrate toxicity gives a High anion gap metabolic acidosis. C is incorrect and the total calcium to ionised calcium ratio would be high in citrate toxicity.&nbsp;</details>

<b> A Antitoxin to botulinum neurotoxin </b><br><br>
Progressive nueromuscular weakness is a common question in the written. The classic presentation of botulism is as above with the treatment being supportive care and trivalent antitoxin. IVIg or plasma exchange is used for GBS but this presents with ascending weakness. Myasthenia gravis is treated with actylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine but should present more gradually and without the examination findings listed. High dose steroids to shorten exacerbations of Multiple sclerosis but it is unlikely to present with these findings. Stroke can be treated with aspirin but this presentation is not compatible with stroke.

What is the mechanism of action of colistin ?<br>
A Inhibits action of bacterial ribosome subunit 50S<br>
B Inhibits action of bacterial ribosome subunit 30S <br>

D Inhibits DNA Gyrase<br>
E Increases permeability of Cell membrane <br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
<b> E Increases permeability of Cell membrane </b><br><br>
Mechanism of antibiotics are a simple question to ask. Beta lactams inhibit cell wall. glycopeptides (vancomycin)   also  inhibit cell wall synthesis. Aminoglycosides and Tetracyclin inhibit 30s subunit. Macrolides and Clindamycin inhibit 50s subunit. Quinolones inhibit DNA gyrase. Trimethoprim and sulfamethozaole inhibit folate synthesis. Nitrofurantoin and metronidazole create free radicals.  <br>

C Haemodylysis <br>
D HIET<br>
E Gastric Lavage <br><br>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer + Explanation</summary><br>
<b> D HIET </b><br><br>
High dose insulin therapy is recommended by toxbase. IABP have been used but this would need to be after trying other treatment. Haemodialysis does not work for CCB overdose due to the high protein binding of the drugs. Gastric lavage is only used within 1 hour of the overdose. <br><Br>CCBs reduce insulin secretion, create insulin resistance, and interfere with glucose catabolism leading to lactic acidosis. In addition CCB interfere with V/Q matching which can cause hypoxia with normal chest xray.

<b> B Bolus 1.5ml/kg of 20% Lipid emulsion </b><br><br>
LAST is highly likley to come up in the exam as is it is very easy to write a question on and anaethetists worry about with their various regional techniques. Amiodarone is not a first line treatment. A second bolus of intralipid is indicated with haemodynamic instability which this patient has. Propofol is in a lipid emulision but the cardiovascular despressing effect render it not useful. If there is ongoing instabillity the infusion rate should be increased to 0.5/ml/kg/MINUTE
